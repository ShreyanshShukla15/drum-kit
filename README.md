interactice drum play kit using html, css and javascript
As my leaning of javascript progressed, in order to practice eventlisteners I tried making a site that may produce some outputs based on mouseclicks and keypresses.
So I tried making this online drum kit that helps user to play drum sounds of different drum elements by clicking on icon or by pressing the corresponding key.
